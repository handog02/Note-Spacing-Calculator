# Note-Spacing-Calculator

This is a note spacing calculator intended for music engravers. The ratios used were conceived by Savva Terentyev here: https://www.patreon.com/posts/53749921

In sheet music, the spacing between the notes varies depending on their length (e.g. a quarter note takes up more space than a sixteenth). We wanted to come up with a quick and systematic way of determining the spacing between the notes. This is aimed at music engravers who do not do their work through notation software such as Sibelius and Musescore.
